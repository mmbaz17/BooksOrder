Attached is a Java Spring API server side generated by Swagger. The API's endpoints are included, and the documentation what it does as well. (if you so choose, any other implementation of API can be demonstrated as long as the endpoints and data fields are the same)
Your mission if you choose to accept, is to create a new endpoint which would be called by Postman to create an In-memory database, you can choose from this list: https://www.baeldung.com/java-in-memory-databases
You in-memory database should be able to handle each of the endpoints, and your API should be functioning, doing these functions: Create, Delete, List, Patch and Retrieve â€“ the aim of the assessment is to see if you are capable of understanding how to do implementation of endpoints, and doing these functions in a database (quick and dirty is also fine).
 
Fields starting with @ can be ignored, exception handling should be implemented on one endpoint. 
Validation should be done on fullName and id fields (if empty should throw exception).
 
Once completed, please upload to free GitHub account and share source code with us for assessment. GitHub Account to share with : LeonFNortje
